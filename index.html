            <hr>
            <p> Groundbreaking new HyperMotion gameplay technology elevates 
            every match in every mode only on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Stadia. 
         </p>
         <br> <br> <br> 
         <h3> What is Hypermotion?</h3>
         <p>  Technology that EA uses to capture players and their behaviours in-game. The days of 
             capturing player movements in a studio were no more as EA took it to the pitch and captured 
             individual player movement in real 11 vs 11 game scenarios, 
             with each player wearing a state-of-the-art Xsens suit. </p>
