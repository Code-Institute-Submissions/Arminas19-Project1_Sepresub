# Fifa 22

The purpose of the Fifa 22 website was to advertise the FIFA video game, the advertisement was meant to be for viewers in their teens and under to represent the game's age group.
When a user visit's the home page, they will see a navigation menu, a big FIFA 22 picture, and a side box with the price for the game on it. It's intended to give the user more knowledge of where they are at.

## Features 

* Navigation menu
   + My navigation menu has 3 different pages labeled Home, More, and Sign-up. I have an underline to mark where on the website the user is at. 
   + My website is linear so that it's very easy to navigate through, the sections are clearly separated but not too far from each other, all my content is in a different color from the background so that it stands out. 
   + I have created a color and added a font that makes my content look sporty and that fits into my product.

* Header
   + The header on my page is a picture with the title FIFA 22 and there is a football player beside my header.

   + I put multiple images with the header 'Fifa 22' so that the user clearly understands what this webpage is all about.
 
   + The main header has a box with some Pre Order information, the pre-order box tells the user that if you pre-order you get exclusive content, and then the price below is shown.

* Home Page Content

   + The home page content talks about what are the new features of the game, this is done in two different boxes.
   + The content on the home page has a FIFA picture with a FIFA EA Sports logo. 
   + I have made the content in this type of color scheme to make sure it stands out from the background and that it would look sporty so that it would fit my product.

**More page**
 * header
   + I added some new styling to my navigation (in the More page) to add a more cleaner look.
   + The navigation menu fits in with my product and the color scheme so it adds to my look and it looks different than my home page navigation. 
   + This navigation acts just like my home navigation and it has the class active on the More page to let the user know where they are at.

 * Fifa 22 trailer
   + I added a video of the official Fifa 22 trailer to make the website more appealing and interactive to a user. 
   + The video has a title 'Fifa 22 trailer' to let the user know what this video is about. 
   + The purpose of this video is to show the client how the product looks and what to expect.

* More page content 
   + The more page expands content related to the home page. This section focuses on features in the game.
   + I have made the content easy to read by changing the font size and color of my content so that it stands out from the background. 
   + I made the colors a little different than the home page because I wanted to separate the two pages apart.

* Sign-Up Page
   + The sign-up page is intended to be used to join a community of people that talk about FIFA and the user also gets an option to get news (updates) about the game.
   + If a user wants to sign up they need to write their First name, last name, and their email (all of this information is required). They also have to check the yes or no option which is also required to sign up.
   + The sign-up form is valuable to the user if they want more information and updates about the game which will not be shown on the website.

* Footer
   +  I used my footer as a way to create my contact page. Inside my footer, there are 4 social media links which the user can click.
   + In big text, I have written 'Reach out and contact us here to let the user know where to go if they want to contact us. 
   + I put a line of text underneath the header of the footer to let the user know where to go if they want to read more information about the game's features.

    ## Testing
   + I have tested the sign-up form and I have confirmed that the button and link work, you need an email for the email input and all inputs are set to require. 
   + I have confirmed that all the icons and font work.
   + I have confirmed that all my content is easily readable to the user by showing my website to someone else.
   + I have confirmed that my video is fully controllable and that it fully works like it's supposed to.
   + I have tested my website in different browser's such as: Microsft Edge, Chrome, Firefox.
   **Bugs** 
* Solved Bugs
   + I had an issue with adding the FIFA video to my website, later I found out with some help from code institute's Tutor assistance that it was my link and I didn't embed it before adding it to my code. 
   + I had an issue with the display: inline; it wouldn't work properly but I figured it out and margined the home content till it was level.

**Validator Testing**
* HTML
   + No errors or warnings were found for all pages - index More or sign-up.
* CSS 
   + No errors were found but a warning with the contents of 'Imported style sheets are not checked indirect input and file upload modes' which doesn't relate to my CSS.
* Accessibility 
   + I have checked lighthouse and confirmed that my website is easily accessible to users.

**Unfixed Bugs** 
   + I can't move my iframe video to the left, I tried margin, padding, and floats but the only thing that worked was a one line style but the problem is that I cant use @media on it to set height and width, just couldn't connect my CSS to this element. 
   + If I had more time I would try and make this website a bit more responsive.

   + In GitHub repository, I navigated to settings. 
   + I scrolled down to pages, I clicked on the link. 
   + In the source drop-down menu, I selected my branch as - main, and then I got the link to my website.
